Music Key Identification
------------------------

Code for identifying the key of musical pieces given the duration of each note in that piece

Folder Setup
------------

Each milestone should have an accompanying folder in which all of the code and resources for that milestone should be contained. Each folder should have a README file which describes what you are doing and the the approach taken, the README file should also contain instructions on how to run the code including outside packages/resources needed to run the code.

There should also be a folder containing the dataset. If your dataset is large (or just in general it is good practice even if it is not large) you should add a .gitignore so that your dataset does not appear in the repository. But please describe where to put the files in this folder so that the TAs can run the code is necessary.
